<p>I am a Ph.D. candidate at College of Information Sciences and Technology, Penn State. I'm working with <a class="anchor" href="http://jcarroll.ist.psu.edu/">Dr. Jack Carroll</a> and <a class="anchor" href="http://mrosson.ist.psu.edu/">Dr. Mary Beth Rosson</a> to build and evaluate eduational technolgoies that result in better learning outcome. I'm also working with <a class="anchor" href="http://mockus.us/">Dr. Audris Mockus</a> on predictive analytics for customer issues.
</p>
<p>My thesis is about understanding software developers' curation activity in social coding site (GitHub), and providing tools to support such activity.</p>
